    title: "CircRNA Signature Predicts Immunotherapy Response in NSCLC"
    category: "Publication"
    date: "2025-11-10"
    description: "Our research team has identified a novel circRNA signature that can predict immunotherapy response in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, published in Therapeutic Advances in Medical Oncology."
    content: |
      We are pleased to announce the publication of our study in **Therapeutic Advances in Medical Oncology** on circular RNA (circRNA) signatures as biomarkers for immunotherapy response in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      This groundbreaking research demonstrates that specific circRNA expression patterns can serve as reliable predictors of patient response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Key findings include:

      - Identification of a circRNA signature with high predictive accuracy for immunotherapy response
      - Validation of the signature in independent patient cohorts
      - Insights into the molecular mechanisms linking circRNAs to tumor-immune interactions
      - Potential for clinical application in personalized treatment selection

      This work opens new avenues for improving immunotherapy outcomes through circRNA-based biomarker development.
