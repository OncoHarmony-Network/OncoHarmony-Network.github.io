# RNA-based Neoantigen Prediction and Immunotherapy
name: "RNA-based Neoantigen Prediction and Immunotherapy"
category: "RNA Research"
icon: "dna"

# Project Overview
overview: |
  This project develops methods for predicting tumor neoantigens from RNA sequencing data and analyzes their association with immunotherapy response. RNA-based neoantigen prediction provides complementary information to DNA-based approaches by incorporating expression data and alternative splicing events.

# Background
