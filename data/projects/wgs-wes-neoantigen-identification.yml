# WGS/WES-based Neoantigen Identification
name: "WGS/WES-based Neoantigen Identification"
category: "DNA Research"
icon: "microscope"

# Project Overview
overview: |
  This project identifies tumor neoantigens through whole genome and exome sequencing and analyzes their immunogenicity in the context of immunotherapy. Comprehensive identification of neoantigens through WGS/WES provides the foundation for personalized immunotherapy approaches.

# Background
background: |
  Tumor neoantigens arise from somatic mutations and can elicit anti-tumor immune responses. Comprehensive identification of neoantigens through WGS/WES provides the foundation for personalized immunotherapy approaches. This project aims to systematically identify and validate neoantigens using high-throughput sequencing technologies.

# Objectives
objectives:
  - "Systematically identify neoantigens using WGS/WES data"
  - "Evaluate their immunogenicity"
  - "Assess their association with immunotherapy response and clinical outcomes"
  - "Develop neoantigen-based personalized immunotherapy strategies"

# Research Content
content: |
  WGS/WES analysis of tumor-normal pairs, neoantigen prediction using bioinformatics pipelines, immunogenicity assessment using MHC binding assays, correlation with clinical response, and validation in independent cohorts.

# Expected Outcomes
outcomes:
  - "Comprehensive neoantigen catalogs"
  - "Validated immunogenic neoantigens"
  - "Neoantigen signatures for immunotherapy response prediction"

# Roadmap
roadmap:
  - "Sequencing and analysis"
  - "Neoantigen prediction"
  - "Immunogenicity validation"
  - "Clinical correlation"
