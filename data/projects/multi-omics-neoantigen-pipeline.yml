# Multi-omics Neoantigen Prediction Pipeline
name: "Multi-omics Neoantigen Prediction Pipeline"
category: "Algorithm Development"
icon: "cogs"

# Project Overview
overview: |
  This project develops integrated DNA/RNA multi-omics algorithms and standardized workflows for neoantigen prediction to improve accuracy and efficiency in immunotherapy response prediction. Current approaches often rely on DNA data alone, missing important information from RNA expression, splicing, and post-transcriptional modifications.
