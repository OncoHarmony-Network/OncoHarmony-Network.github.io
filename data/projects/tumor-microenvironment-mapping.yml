# Tumor Microenvironment Mapping Project
name: "Tumor Microenvironment Mapping"
type: "Research Program"
icon: "microscope"

# Project Overview
overview: |
  This project aims to map the dynamic molecular variations in tumor microenvironment (TME) to understand immune evasion mechanisms and identify novel therapeutic targets. By employing single-cell analysis, spatial transcriptomics, and multi-omics integration, we seek to unravel the complex cellular and molecular interactions within the TME.

# Background
background: |
  The tumor microenvironment is a complex ecosystem comprising cancer cells, immune cells, stromal cells, blood vessels, and signaling molecules. Understanding the dynamic interactions within the TME is crucial for developing effective immunotherapy strategies. Current bulk tissue analyses mask the heterogeneity and spatial organization of TME components. Our project leverages cutting-edge single-cell and spatial omics technologies to achieve unprecedented resolution in TME characterization.

# Objectives
