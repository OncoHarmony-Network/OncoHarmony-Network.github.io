# ERV Expression and Immunotherapy Response
name: "ERV Expression and Immunotherapy Response"
category: "RNA Research"
icon: "virus"

# Project Overview
overview: |
  This project investigates the association between endogenous retrovirus (ERV) expression profiles, tumor immunogenicity, and immunotherapy response. ERV reactivation in cancer can enhance tumor immunogenicity and potentially improve immunotherapy response.

# Background
background: |
  Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are remnants of ancient viral infections integrated into the human genome. ERV reactivation in cancer can enhance tumor immunogenicity and potentially improve immunotherapy response. Understanding ERV expression patterns and their relationship with immune activation could lead to novel biomarkers and therapeutic strategies.

# Objectives
objectives:
  - "Characterize ERV expression patterns in immunotherapy-treated patients"
  - "Identify ERV signatures associated with treatment response"
  - "Elucidate mechanisms of ERV-mediated immune activation"
  - "Develop ERV-based biomarkers and therapeutic strategies"

# Research Content
content: |
  ERV expression profiling in tumor samples, correlation with clinical outcomes, analysis of immune cell infiltration, mechanistic studies of ERV-induced immune responses, and validation in preclinical models.

# Expected Outcomes
outcomes:
  - "ERV-based biomarkers for immunotherapy response"
  - "Mechanistic insights into ERV-mediated immune activation"
  - "Potential strategies for ERV-targeted therapies"
  - "Publication of 2-3 high-impact papers"

# Roadmap
roadmap:
  - "ERV profiling"
  - "Clinical correlation"
  - "Mechanistic studies"
  - "Preclinical validation"
