# Mutational Signatures and Immunotherapy Response
name: "Mutational Signatures and Immunotherapy Response"
category: "DNA Research"
icon: "signature"

# Project Overview
overview: |
  This project analyzes the association between tumor mutational signatures and response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Tumor mutational signatures reflect underlying mutagenic processes and can influence tumor immunogenicity.

# Background
background: |
  Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment strategies, but low patient response rates remain a core challenge limiting its application. Revealing the mechanisms of immunotherapy response heterogeneity through tumor immuno-omics data mining and computational research has become a research frontier. DNA mutational signatures, as molecular fingerprints of tumor genome mutation processes, provide a new perspective for analyzing tumor-microenvironment interactions and predicting immunotherapy efficacy. However, their potential as molecular biomarkers, regulatory effects on tumor microenvironment, and underlying mechanisms remain unclear.

# Objectives
objectives:
  - "Study the relationship between mutational signatures, tumor immune microenvironment, and immunotherapy response"
  - "Develop computational methods and tools for mutational signature analysis"
  - "Mine molecular biomarkers associated with immunotherapy response"
  - "Construct predictive models for immunotherapy efficacy"

# Research Content
content: |
  Mutational signature analysis using WGS/WES data, correlation with clinical response, integration with immune profiling, development of predictive models, and validation in independent cohorts.

# Expected Outcomes
