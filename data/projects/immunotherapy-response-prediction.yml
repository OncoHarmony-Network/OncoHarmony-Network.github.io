# Immunotherapy Response Prediction Project
name: "Immunotherapy Response Prediction"
type: "Research Program"
icon: "chart-line"

# Project Overview
overview: |
  This comprehensive research program aims to develop robust predictive models for immunotherapy response through multi-omics analysis. By integrating RNA and DNA biomarkers, neoantigen identification, and AI-driven approaches, we seek to enable personalized immunotherapy strategies for cancer patients.

# Background
background: |
  Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), has revolutionized cancer treatment. However, only a subset of patients responds to these therapies, highlighting the critical need for predictive biomarkers. Current approaches rely on limited biomarkers such as PD-L1 expression and tumor mutational burden (TMB), which have limited predictive accuracy. Our program takes a holistic approach by integrating multiple layers of genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data to develop comprehensive predictive models.

# Objectives
objectives:
  - "Develop multi-omics biomarker panels for immunotherapy response prediction"
  - "Identify novel RNA and DNA biomarkers associated with treatment outcomes"
