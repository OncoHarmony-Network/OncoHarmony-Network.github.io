# CircRNA-based Immunotherapy Response Biomarkers
name: "CircRNA-based Immunotherapy Response Biomarkers"
category: "RNA Research"
icon: "circle-notch"

# Project Overview
overview: |
  This research project focuses on identifying and validating circular RNA (circRNA) signatures as predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy response in cancer patients. CircRNAs are stable, tissue-specific non-coding RNAs that play crucial roles in tumor-immune interactions.

# Background
background: |
  Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs with covalently closed loop structures, making them highly stable and resistant to degradation. Emerging evidence suggests circRNAs play crucial roles in tumor-immune interactions and may serve as reliable biomarkers for predicting immunotherapy response. Their stability in body fluids also makes them attractive candidates for non-invasive biomarker development.

# Objectives
objectives:
  - "Identify circRNA signatures that accurately predict patient response to immune checkpoint inhibitors"
  - "Validate these signatures in independent patient cohorts"
  - "Elucidate the molecular mechanisms linking circRNAs to tumor-immune microenvironment modulation"
  - "Develop circRNA-based diagnostic assays for clinical use"

# Research Content
content: |
  Systematic profiling of circRNA expression in immunotherapy-treated patients, identification of response-associated circRNAs using machine learning approaches, functional validation of candidate circRNAs in vitro and in vivo, development of circRNA-based predictive models, and clinical validation in prospective cohorts.

# Expected Outcomes
outcomes:
  - "A validated circRNA signature panel for immunotherapy response prediction"
  - "Mechanistic insights into circRNA-mediated immune regulation"
  - "Potential therapeutic targets for improving immunotherapy outcomes"

# Roadmap
roadmap:
  - "Retrospective cohort analysis"
  - "Signature identification and validation"
  - "Mechanistic studies"
  - "Clinical validation"
