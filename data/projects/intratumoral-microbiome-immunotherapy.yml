# Intratumoral Microbiome and Immunotherapy Efficacy
name: "Intratumoral Microbiome and Immunotherapy Efficacy"
category: "RNA Research"
icon: "bacteria"

# Project Overview
overview: |
  This project investigates the impact of intratumoral microbiome on immunotherapy effectiveness and elucidates underlying mechanisms. Recent studies have revealed the presence of microbiota within tumors, which may modulate immune responses and influence immunotherapy outcomes.

# Background
background: |
  Recent studies have revealed the presence of microbiota within tumors, which may modulate immune responses and influence immunotherapy outcomes. Understanding the role of intratumoral microbiome could lead to novel therapeutic strategies. This project aims to characterize intratumoral microbiome composition and its association with immunotherapy response.

# Objectives
objectives:
  - "Characterize intratumoral microbiome composition in immunotherapy-treated patients"
  - "Identify microbial signatures associated with treatment response"
  - "Elucidate mechanisms of microbiome-mediated immune modulation"
  - "Develop microbiome-modulating therapeutic strategies"

# Research Content
content: |
  Microbiome profiling using 16S rRNA sequencing and metagenomics, correlation with clinical outcomes, immune cell profiling, mechanistic studies using germ-free models, and validation in preclinical systems.

# Expected Outcomes
outcomes:
  - "Microbiome-based biomarkers for immunotherapy response"
  - "Mechanistic understanding of microbiome-immune interactions"
  - "Potential microbiome-modulating therapies"
  - "Publication of 2-3 high-impact papers"

# Roadmap
roadmap:
  - "Microbiome profiling"
